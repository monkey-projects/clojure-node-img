# MonkeyProjects Clojure Image

This is a Docker image setup that extends the default [Clojure image](https://hub.docker.com/_/clojure/)
with [node](https://nodejs.org) and `npm`, useful for building [Shadowjs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs)
projects that use the [Tools cli](https://clojure.org/reference/deps_and_cli).
